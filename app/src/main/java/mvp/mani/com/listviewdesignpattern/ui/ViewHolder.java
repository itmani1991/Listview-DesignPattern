/**
 * FLYWEIGHT PATTERN
 * <p/>
 * PROBLEM: findViewById() is an expensive method because it traverses through the view hierarchy
 * to find a view with a matching id. If called frequently it can affect ListView performance.
 * <p/>
 * INTENT: Create a ViewHolder class to act as a Flyweight object. Only create one instance
 * and then cache it for future use so any unneeded findViewById() calls will not be invoked.
 * <p/>
 * INFO: The ListView will make calls to the ListAdapter's getView() method each time it needs a view
 * at a given index. Because the ListView only holds a certain amount of views in memory at a time
 * it can end up recreating the same views over and over as needed, resulting in a lot of calls to
 * findViewById() for each new view it creates. To avoid this performance hit we can cache each
 * view returned from findViewById() into a ViewHolder object that can be reused the next time
 * the ListView recreates the same view.
